# Web Design Challenge

### CWRU Homework Week 11

This assignment was to demonstrate use of Bootstrap to create a dashboard for data visualizations. The coding was done using HTML and CSS with media queries. The site is hosted on GitHub pages and can be found here:

[Web Visualization Page](https://lbrady1025.github.io/web-design-challenge/index.html)

The visualizations were obtained from an analysis of weather as it relates to the proximite to the equator based on data that was obtained from the OpenWeather API. Images of scatterplots created with Matplotlib were embedded into the site. The navbar contains the links to the individual plots for the maximum temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed. It also contains the links to the comparisons of the data and a table of the data itself. The data was formatted using a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Lbrady1025/web-design-challenge/blob/main/WebVisualizations/Resources/cities.ipynb) and exported to HTML. The table is available on [this page](https://lbrady1025.github.io/web-design-challenge/data.html).

Media queries were used in the [style.css](https://github.com/Lbrady1025/web-design-challenge/blob/main/style.css) to make the website mobile responsive.

The [reset.css](https://github.com/Lbrady1025/web-design-challenge/blob/main/reset.css) code was obtained through the public doman reset code available at [meyerweb.com](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
